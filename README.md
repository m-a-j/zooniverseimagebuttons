#Zooniverse "Image Buttons"

Tired of changing the number of the file, just so you can take a look at the next picture?
Use my firefox add-on, with its 2+1 buttons that facilitate looking through a series of pictures from WildcamGorongosa.org, ChimpAndSee.org, SnapshotSerengeti.org and other sites from the zooniverse network.

Click "Download ZIP" (see right) and open "zooniverseimagebuttons-X.X.X.xpi" with firefox to install.
